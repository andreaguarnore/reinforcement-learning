### Overview
This repository provides simple implementations of some fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms.

### Implemented algorithms
Dynamic programming:
- Policy iteration
- Value iteration

Value-based reinforcement learning:
- Monte Carlo methods (first-visit MC, every-visit MC, and off-policy MC)
- Temporal difference methods (Sarsa and Q-learning)

Policy-based reinforcement learning:
- REINFORCE (i.e. Monte Carlo policy gradient)
- Actor-critic
